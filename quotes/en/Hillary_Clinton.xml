Or maybe he doesn&apos;t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he&apos;s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody&apos;s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn&apos;t pay any federal income tax. So if he&apos;s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he&apos;s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he&apos;s trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statements, they don&apos;t give you the tax rate. They don&apos;t give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he&apos;s ever going to release his tax returns, because there&apos;s something he&apos;s hiding.</quote><quote id="265" author="Hillary Clinton" cats="Democratic Party (United States) politicians|Living people|Members of the United States Senate|People from Arkansas|People from Illinois|United States First ladies|United States Secretaries of State|United States presidential candidates, 2008|United States presidential candidates, 2016" ref="">Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.</quote><quote id="266" author="Hillary Clinton" cats="Democratic Party (United States) politicians|Living people|Members of the United States Senate|People from Arkansas|People from Illinois|United States First ladies|United States Secretaries of State|United States presidential candidates, 2008|United States presidential candidates, 2016" ref="">The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together.
